# twitter
Simple command line interface to make calls to the Twitter API

Example, calling:

    python t.py get followers screen_name=celiala cursor=-1
  
Gets the json returned from TwitterAPI's followers/list REST endpoint, and saves it to a file. It also 
keeps track of the next_cursor value, so that you can just call:

    python t.py next followers
  
To get the next batch of followers for @celiala.

To see the list of all commands that have been preconfigured, look at RESOURCE in client/config.py.

In order to this to run, you will need Twitter API tokens, which you'll need to save into your os environment params, etc:

    export CONSUMER_KEY="--YOUR-VALUE-HERE--

See OAUTH_KEYS in client/config.py for all the environment params you need to set.
